            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>
                Text-to-Music Retrieval, finding music based on a given natural language query, plays a pivotal role in content discovery within extensive music databases. To address this challenge, prior research has predominantly focused on a joint embedding of music audio and text, utilizing it to retrieve music tracks that exactly match descriptive queries related to musical attributes (i.e. genre, instrument) and contextual elements (i.e. mood, theme). However, users also articulate a need to explore music that shares similarities with their favorite tracks or artists, such as \textit{I need a similar track to Superstition by Stevie Wonder}. To address these concerns, this paper proposes an improved Text-to-Music Retrieval model, denoted as \textbf{TTMR++}, which utilizes rich text descriptions generated with a finetuned large language model and metadata. To accomplish this, we obtained various types of seed text from several existing music tag and caption datasets and a knowledge graph dataset of artists and tracks. The experimental results show the effectiveness of TTMR++ in comparison to state-of-the-art music-text joint embedding models through a comprehensive evaluation involving various musical text queries.

            <h4>Testset Demo</h4>
            <p>ðŸŒŸ "In order to substantiate the model's prowess in generalization, we meticulously curated a testset from a dazzling array of 2.8k samples sourced from the music caption evaluation split. This demonstration is set to unveil the dynamic interplay of semantic captions, tags, and artist conditions in a riveting search scenario. Moreover, we are delighted to present comprehensive annotations for the music captions." ðŸŽ¶</p>

Then a synth plays a lead using string sounds. This is accompanied by distortion guitars playing power chords. The bass continues to play funky fills and the percussion continues to play a fast beat.

After a few seconds the volume is dialed down and one can hear a melody being created from electronic sounds and possibly a bass guitar. In the background a metallic percussive instrument is being played with bare hands</small> </th>
